---------------------------------
To-do
-Re-enable weapon sway
-Add suppression cvars from Ballou's betterbots
-Add hunt maps
-Spectator cannot view chat
-Give the auto Glock the same ammo as M9
RETRACTED (too time consuming; little to no benefit)-Give the auto Glock it's own ammo so the ap, hp, and default has 10 in the mag
---------------------------------

-VIP insurgent is using knife only; this happens on some maps apparently. Changed his weapon from MK18 to FAL.
-Insurgent with black vest and heavy armor with no helmet is also using knife only and happens on some maps. This bot uses a C79 scope even thought it is not in the loadout. Replacing the character skin fixed this.
-Wingnut also reports some bots coming in as errors and knives. I came in and saw this. It was on revolt_checkpoint. Try to load this map again and see if you see the errors again. Then have insurgent bots only one class to narrow down the culprit. Hopefully it is fixed by changing the character skin and removing the MK18 from the VIP.

-thetheaterfile014.theater
-Notes: These bot changes are meant to relieve the dull, same four kinds of bots. They are meant to encourage replayability and dynamic gameplay that challenge the players. The player should be more cautious and careful around a heavy armored machine gunner. The introduction of the sniper and suppressed bot encourages the player to be more aware of their surroundings and open areas. Players should be wary not to bunch up and instead spread out as a result of a slight increase in the number of RPG bots. More bots now carry a grenade as a reminder to stay attentive to the sound of one being thrown.
-Added sniper class (sharpshooter template) to use the mosin for bots
