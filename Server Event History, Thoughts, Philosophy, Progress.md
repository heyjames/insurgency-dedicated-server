I grew up playing online first-person shooters like Half-Life, Team Fortress Classic, and the original Counter-Strike--all based on Valve's Source game engine. Unlike traditional multiplayer games today, there was a server browser for filtering servers. This can be based on maximum players allowed, passworded servers, and servers that aren't empty, etc. Each server was setup by one or a group of individuals that actually customize the game with specific rules, so one server might have the respawn timer changed from 10 seconds to 0 seconds. While some servers leave the default server settings on, others make drastic changes to the multiplayer gameplay through the Source engine's various server settings. Some servers have their own website and rules, code of conduct, and voice chat server. These servers are mostly known as dedicated servers. A dedicated server can run 24/7 in the background without the need to run the client.

In contrast, a listen server is very simple to setup. I've tried that before, but there are limited server customization options, and it didn't set itself apart from any other server with default server settings. It also meant that I had to have the game running, as if I was playing, for people to connect. All I had to do was enable console in the game options, press the tilde key to launch the consonle, type "map de_dust", and have others connect to my external IP address. I also had to forward ports in my router so my friend could connect to my listen server. Nowadays, forwarding ports no longer work at my location, thanks to Comcast.

After I became bored with Counter-Strike, I stopped playing "twitch" online shooters and played single player story-focused games on consoles for several years and gradually played fewer video games.

Gaming died down for almost a decade until I found a new source game called Insurgency. Insurgency was another source engine game similar to Counter-Strike, but modified the game to represent a more tactical and realistic gunplay. Your in-game character dies in 1-2 shots, you don't have kill confirmations/kill cams that are prevalent in the online FPS genre, no crosshairs (you have to aim down sights), reloading a new magazine when it is half used doesn't magically reallocate bullets to refill an entire magazine, and the huge recoil must be handled properly for each firearm, requiring the player to shoot in burst or semi-automatic mode for optimal shots.

Even with these tactical gameplay elements in Insurgency coop mode, players in almost all servers I've played in do not play tactically. It's definitely influenced by the "run and gun" playstyle when Call of Duty: Modern Warfare launched, which came right after the decline of tactical shooters like Rainbow Six and Ghost Recon. I loved the classic Rainbow Six and Ghost Recon Tom Clancy series, but methodic and slow-paced shooters was--and still is--a somewhat dead genre.

Then, I joined a server called INS Militia. Before anyone mentioned their strict rules to me, I noticed that no one walked into the capture zone even though the first wave of enemies appeared to be neutralized. After a moment of silence, I slowly walked into the capture zone by myself and was immediately introduced to the rules. I was supposed to wait for the final approval that "everyone was ready to capture" by a guy named Jebgamer.

In other games, players would rush to that area while enemies still roam the area--they wanted to beat the map as fast as they can get away with it and move on to the next map.

While some servers list their server as tactical, team play, they are never enforced or played that way by players. This isn't the case with INS Militia. There are several guidelines that are enforced almost all the time as there are plenty of admins on rotation. One annoyance when playing with others is how often someone "runs and guns" and walks into the fire lane. You're shooting down a lane and someone walks in front of you so they can secure the kill and raise their kill/death ratio. They also make sure players turn off flashlights when aiming in another player's direction to prevent turning their teammate's screen white.

INS Militia have a simple way to playing the cooperative checkpoint mode: clear the area of bots, plant c4 to ambush the counter-attack, wait for the entire team to be ready, take the objective together, detonate c4 when the counter-attack wave spawns, clear the area of any remaining enemies, and repeat. All the other servers I've played at, the players rush to capture the objective and leaves their teammates in the kill zone as enemies spawn everywhere upon capturing a point.

It was such a refreshing experience because this group of players communicated often over voice comms what they were doing while securing an area, sometimes mirroring military callouts. It was no surprise after hearing some of them were former military.

Aside from the strictly enforced rules, I also noticed changes in the gameplay that I haven't seen on other servers. The game normally restricts the player to a set pathway from one objective to another. This means that although you can walk into a "restricted area", your weapon will be disabled in a few seconds. Imagine walking a specified path to the playground area in the middle of a large park and couldn't walk across the open grass area or enter from the other side with tall trees. This makes the game (and map) quite linear. INS Militia removes this restriction, and for good reason. You cannot clear the area when you approach a checkpoint, so although you cleared the path you're allowed to walk on, new enemies will come from areas that could take out the entire team from restricted paths. Restricting players from these areas also prevents tactical gameplay like flanking the enemy as well as increasing the gameplay longevity by allowing more choices and multiple pathways for each round.

Another unique feature on the server was the ability to have two primary slots. Normally, you're allowed one primary, one secondary, two explosives, choice of light or heavy armor, and choice of a small or large vest to unlock the one or two explosive slots, all of which can increase your weight and slow your character's speed.

I attempted to emulate the server for fun because it is the only server I found does so many things different that makes the game better in coop. It wasn't easy because it's a relatively new and unknown game and there is almost no documentation for doing any of this. If there is, it's most likely outdated or incomplete.

I began by setting up a listen server on my PC because that's the only thing I've always known how to do for source engine games. This is simply done by opening the console with the tilde key in-game and typing "map ministry_coop". Another player would then have to type "connect xxx.xxx.xxx.xx:27015" in console to connect. Here, I started to learn and use simple client variables (cvars) and there are a lot of source engine games like this one (Counter-Strike Global Offensive). A CVAR command is like writing "ins_bot_difficulty 1" or with "0" in the console while you're hosting a listen or dedicated server, or putting it in the server configuration file to set the game difficulty.

No one was able to join my listen server, unfortunately. I knew I had to forward my ports and allow the game through my firewall from previous multiplayer gaming experiences, but it didn't work. It's a long story about how anything I did was futile, so feel free to skip the next paragraph.

I thought it was my firewall, so instead of allowing the port/game in my firewall, I installed the game on an old laptop with a fresh Windows install, disabled Windows firewall and connected it directly to the internet without a firewall. It still didn't work. I was connecting to the router for this, so I thought maybe it's my router. I already forwarded the port on my router, though. Maybe it's the Comcast modem I have; it's the kind that has a built-in wireless router and modem together, but I disabled the wireless portion so I can use my own router. I tried to access the port forward page of the Comcast modem, but still, no one can connect to my listen server. I called Comcast technical support and informed them about my issue, but all they did was Google my specific issue--resulting in the same searches I've already tried. They ultimately could not help. Then I remembered years ago reading about how a user could not host a MineCraft server even though he/she forwarded the correct ports. Then it goes on about how Comcast began to block ports on their side to prevent users from hosting anything like a small web server to force users to subscribe to their much more expensive Business package. That user said he/she even contacted Comcast and was told that he/she would have to subscribe to their Business Package because they are hosting a MineCraft server even if for a couple of his/her friends to connect for a couple hours a day; hosting a server of any kind would be a breach of terms of their current home internet package, according to Comcast. I also noticed that in the several years back, I never had trouble forwarding a port to allow a couple different games to host a room for my friend and I to play on. More recently, I also never had trouble forwarding ports in a couple of different apartments in college that were also Comcast Internet subscribers. I also never had trouble forwarding ports for BitTorrent at home many years ago, whereas now, it always tells me it's not forwarded even thought I'm following my usual port forwarding techniques. I thought it was the modem/router combo I was working with and its outdated user interface, so I even bought a new modem that didn't have a router combo inside and that didn't work either.Comcast wouldn't acknowledge that it was blocking any ports either, but I'm sure if I even included the word "server", they'd direct me to their Business plan. My only next test or way to move forward would be to sign up with their business plan, but I'm not paying that for an Insurgency server.

While Googling more about cvars for the game, I found that I can allow users to to have more supply points to carry more weapons and other items--one of the things I see in a lot of other servers actually. I find the game is more fun to be able to choose any and all kinds of attachments/weapons without being restricted by a currency system. I can understand its application in PvP, but not here in coop. The computer controlled enemies are only as good as the programmers who programmed them, so they have the advantage of random, but not so random precise aiming. Having player choice adds replayability and more content for the player to play with.

Seeing how no one was able to join my game with a listen server, I tried to run a dedicated server in Windows to see if the listen server was the reason my friend couldn't join.The game ran fine with the couple of custom CVARS I added, but again, no one outside of the local area network could join. I was able to join from another computer inside the local area network, though.

At this point, I was convincing myself that it was anything but Comcast and I thought maybe it could have been Windows--not a very logical thought process, but it did give me a reason to explore the world of Linux. It's an OS that i've always wanted to become more familiar with because of it's open-source nature and its prominent usage in the world of programming. I retrieved that old laptop with the fresh Windows install and installed Ubuntu and got the game up and running again. Still, no one could join. Some guides online stressed not to allow the game server run under "root", which helped me understand some terminal duties like adding a user, granting that user "sudo" privileges, and file permissions pertaining to users. This part was actually really helpful because, even though no one could join the server, I know that this platform is basically a copy of what the real production version would look like since it's running on Linux. It allowed me to test how to implement more features I liked in the INS Militia server.

Here are several customized features of INS Miltia that I believed made the gameplay much better:
-32+ bots on each counter-attack vs default 12 bots
	I've tested gameplay changes to this and found that more is better.
-100% counter-attack compared to the 75% default chance
-remove restricted area
-frequently list rules in the chat area
-customized weapons arrangement (some default primary weapons moved to secondary slot)
-two primary weapon slots
-weapon and item costs one or zero
-high supply points to spend on weapons/items
-custom maps made by the community
-spectators and dead players can freely talk and chat with each other
-capturing a point takes longer
-stepping off of a capture zone immediately depletes the capture percentage compared to frozen or slowly depleting versions i've seen across many servers
-Allow 12 players to join

I could only achieve several of these features because I was dealing with CVARS, which were easy to do, but slightly difficult to find which ones I can use and what value I can associate with the keys from any guides or forum posts online. The other features dealt with something called a custom theater file and the one partial, outdated guide online seemed quite difficult to understand, so I held off on learning that. I didn't even know what I could achieve from this thing called a theater file at the time; I just know that it was one place that could add more customization to the game that I couldn't understand.

-high supply points to spend on weapons/items
-stepping off of a capture zone immediately depletes the capture percentage compared to the frozen or slowly depleting versions i've seen across many servers
-capturing a point takes longer
-32+ bots on each counter-attack
-100% counter-attack compared to the 75% default chance

After implementing these few features listed above in the server config file via CVARS, I thought about a virtual private server.

I always held onto the notion of never spending money to achieve something I believed I could do on my own if it meant I had to put in more work or do a workaround. Hosting an Insurgency server fell under something that I was supposed to be able to do without having to pay for something like a VPS. Note: Thinking about it now, it was a good thing people couldn't connect to my listen server because I would have never learned all of this. I thought I could spend zero dollars by using my own PC as a server. That wasn't happening, thanks most likely to Comcast. I knew about virtual private servers, but was financially discouraged to use them. I wanted to see this through, though, and I wanted to succeed pretty badly at this point as it's been something I've wanted to accomplish and explore for a long time. I also don't like "losing" or giving up at that point after all the effort I've done trying to get this server working the way I envision it. While searching for VPS, Digital Ocean's name came up often, and I remember a friend of mine (who is the creator and founder of www.oldapps.com) told me to use it if I ever wanted to start a website when I asked him what it was like when he started his big website. I noticed that I could get $10 credit if I was a new user, which means two free months to experiment. At this point, I already had the whole process of setting up the server step-by-step from having done it on the laptop with Ubuntu. The server configuration files were all ready to be transferred to it, so hypothetically, all I would need to do is replicate the process all within a terminal and without the desktop interface. I then proceeded to sign up. 

It was a fairly easy process to setup. I setup a barebones and default server just to quickly test whether or not my friend and I can connect and it worked. It really worked. Having set all this up previously with my own Linux computer made this process so easy. I setup PuTTY and FileZilla so I can start using my own terminal window (opposed to the limited web version at Digital Ocean), and start transferring files over SFTP. I actually learned to use PuTTY from one of my supervisors who started me on this programming career path about a year ago.

I thought what I accomplished at this point was pretty cool, and I showed my friend the progress I made. I put this aside for a while as my motivation for learning the custom theater file was low. I kept looking online and also looking at the server files every now and then, and I stumbled upon a variable in another server configuration file that handles playlists. Playlists are theater files that came with the game and you can just set one of the playlist item's name in the server config and your server would run a theater file different from the standard default one. I thought the idea of having a few number of bots but having them wear heavy armor would be fun, and one of the theater files that came with the game has just that (called "hardcore"). Then I can limit the number of enemies using a CVAR. One odd thing happened, though. I was no longer able to have the high number of supply points I set as a CVAR. It's disabled whenever I have the playlist in effect. After many attempts to circumvent this through Google searches, I emailed a known server owner by the name of ConnorHD, whose servers I've played and liked that has this combination of high supply points and heavy armored bots. He told me that I can use a theater override for one of the custom theaters that is included in the game. Playlists can make use of these custom theaters but it is specifically for ranking, so some things--like my custom supply points--are locked. Using a theater override command in the server config allows full control over the server while a custom theater file is in effect. It was also nice to know he is a developer here in San Francisco.

Now, my server has the elite version of the theater with plenty of supply points for the player to use in this harder difficulty setting. Enemies all wear heavy armor and helmets, so they take more hits to go down. I haven't opened up the server to the public yet, but I had also asked the INS Militia server administrator to change his second server to have a similar setup of heavy armored bots, but decreased number of bots to present a greater challenge to the player. Each encounter would be more interesting and encourage the player to be extra cautious. I had the idea that because the 32+ number of unarmored default bots, they seem to act like cannon fodder given that the AI is not very sophisticated since they would just walk single-file into a choke point into gunfire from the entire team. I didn't want the gameplay to be so one-sided as that didn't challenge the player. I didn't want the player to play so passively. Unfortunately, it wasn't as fun as I thought. The game seemed really slow and empty, and no one was really interested in joining that server. I can say now that that game mode works poorly in this situation because there are a lot of maps that vary in size, so some maps won't work well with the fewer bots. Having a lot of people in the game worked against this game mode as there aren't enough enemies for players to shoot, and shooting enemies is a core fun factor in the game. This game mode would actually work well in small to medium maps only with about 2 or 3 players.

I wanted to also get the administrator functions working because I always hear about this menu the INS Militia admins use to change map, kick players, and change gravity among other functions. This eventually led me to find SourceMod; it is used in many Source Engine games like Counter strike GO and Team Fortress 2. FYI SourceMod doesn't work on Listen servers. There is a pretty good amount of documentation on SourceMod. I had some initial issues with SourceMod because i didn't know it had a depenecy on MetaMod. There are some version incompatibility too, so newer versions of SM and MM don't work on my server. I was really happy with this as it meant the beginning of all the other cool server additions i can add just like INS Militia's. I set myself up as an administrator in a config file, which required some reading and trial and error in-game. And there it was, all the administrative features I always heard about, now on a server of my own. 

Banning is actually more complicated than it seems. Although it can be easily done in the administrator menu, once the player leaves, which many like to leave immediately after killing the team, their name no longer appears in the ban menu. To resolve this, you have to type several specific commands in the console as the top server admin. You have to actually search through your previous players from recent games to grab the player, copy his profile URL and run it through a 3rd party website to retrieve the steam id and then use that steam id in the console command. You have to change one number in that steam id to represent the public and private, too. Banning one version of their id is not enough. The ban also doesn't take effect unless the map has been changed if this method of banning via console is used. I had to figure all of this out by banning myself from the server to test over and over all the intricacies surrounding the different ways to ban someone to find out the things listed in this paragraph.

While searching for the restricted area removal plugin, I found Jared Ballou's site; he's a former Insurgency developer and his site had a lot of plugins he made for SourceMod including the removal of restricted area plugin. Apparently, the plugins require SourceMod, which I just installed, and it was a simple placement of files and dependencies in the SourceMod plugins folder for it to work. I loaded up a map and restricted areas were immediately in effect.

I also found a plugin to increase the default max player slot of 8 to 12 and installed it, but it requires more work to get it working, and i didn't find it that important at the moment so i left the plugin alone in the event that i wanted to make a 12 player slot server.

There were many times when a player was stuck and required a player to suicide and ask the admin for a respawn in INS Militia, and although the slay command came with SourceMod, the respawn did not. I installed the respawn plugin from Ballou's website and it worked perfectly. This was important because other than players getting stuck, there are a lot of toxic players who team kill, and thwarting their effort to distrupt the gameplay is now just a few simple key presses away.

It was difficult to search for this next plugin because the search terms regarding this feature is unusually specific. I wanted the chat area to pop-up with texts to show the rules to remind new players who come in to see how this server's playerbase operates. I eventually stumble upon it and it's called "advertisements". I installed that plugin and configured it appropriately to display similar rules found in INS Militia.

So far, I only have a few items left, but most of it lies in the theater file (I wasn't even sure what exactly the theater file could do at this point in time):

-customized weapons arrangement (some default primary weapons moved to secondary slot)
-two primary weapon slots
-weapon and item costs one or zero
-custom maps
-spectators and dead players can freely talk and chat with each other
-Allow 12 players to join

I was so close now, that I tried to gather as much information I can about theater files. I notice that whenever I join a server, I sometimes see in the corner that it downloads a theater file for a split second. I used the slow-motion camera feature on my phone to capture what the entire message said. I looked online and found that there is a folder that contains all of these theater files. There were a lot here--all downloaded from the many custom theater-running servers I visited. I compared the difference between INS Militia and these. Because I knew some features are unique to INS Militia, I can spot the one area that is specific to the feature. For instance, INS Militia removed the slide function where a sprinting player can slide into cover. Then I thought that that line of text that said "1200" next to some key that vaguely represented slide run has to have some sort of organization. I will try to do whatever I can to create a new file and space them out really far apart from each other in Sublime Text editor, which has a nice overview pane on the right so I can monitor the different sections. I basically partitioned the text file and organize it as best I can.

I noticed that all the custom theater files I looked at included some aspects of the game's properties while another left it out entirely. This must mean that to include it, means to incur a change to the game, whereas when it is not included, then a default value is taken. This must also mean that there is a default theater lying somewhere in the game folder. This supported my thought about using the custom elite theater, and I bet i'll find it wherever these default theaters are held. After some more Google searches, I found that the default theater files are inside a .vpk file in the game folder. Opening it required a small piece of software called GFCscape. I downloaded it and opened the vpk file. It was all there. This is where the "playlist's" source is: the elite, hardcore, default theater files. The theater files here were sometimes split up and incomplete versus the ones I downloaded from visiting custom servers. It appears that the "include" line at the top connects them all together just like in regular programming. The separation of files matched my version of a spaced out, long theater file downloaded from all those community dedicated servers I visited while playing the game. This default theater must be the full version and the custom INS Militia must consist of only the values that needed to be different from the default.

This is the most difficult part because this file is lengthy and there is next to no documentation online. After some time testing other features, I vaguely remembered this odd occurrence I had one time trying to launch a listen server. I typed "map ministry_coop" in console to test out a weapon's recoil for example. While I was testing a weapon, I still had the 2 primary weapon slots and each character class names from insmiltia. I quickly made the connection that i had just disconnected from insmilitia's server and loaded up the listen server in console. It must have carried over the theater file onto my listen server and that also means the theater file is on my computer somewhere. It must be one of the 60 or so files in that one folder that had all the theater files downloaded from visiting servers. It was overwhelming without documentation. I put it aside here for another day and thought it would be too much work. 

I just had the thought that there must be some way I can load the ins militia's theater file on my computer into my listen server, and luckily found an obscure forum post deep into a Google search about a console command to do just that.

I made small minor changes to ins militia's theater file, launched Insurgency, open console, and typed the command to override the insmilitia's theater file in my theater files folder, typed "map ministry_coop", and immediately saw how my edited insmilitia theater file operated in-game. I can see the changes I make in my custom theater affecting the game how I want. The keys and values and format are beginning to make sense. I also took small features that seem isolated to one small area in INS Militia and copy+paste it to a default theater and it worked. For example, taking a default theater file and adding the line from ins militia's no slide after sprint "1200" value to it.

Learning about the default theater files in the game directory, studying the differences between the many theater files I downloaded, and finding the command to override a theater file to my choosing really helped me understand what is going on on each line in the theater file. I stayed up late making many minor changes to many variables in all sections and immediately launching the game with it and was just having a blast testing each key value in the theater file.

Now that I know a lot about how the theater file worked, I began to change it to represent what I want on my server including but not limited to: player classes, class restrictions, explosive damage output, weapons allowed for each class, allowed attachments for each weapon, default player loadouts for each class, weapon properties, attachment properties, and disabled attachments for different weapons. I will describe later on a lot of the customization I made, the thought that went into a change, what worked and what didn't work. I even found a solution to a bug that bothered me in ins militia's servers.

Once I had this to a near completion, I woke up the next afternoon to find that the game developers released a new update and didn't provide documentation for the theater file changes. This meant I had to figure out what was broken by launching the game and looking at the new default theater file in the game folder and comparing it to the old theater file. I was really tired from studying it the previous night, but fortunately, I'm well versed in the theater file now to quickly discern where I needed to address the problems, and I was determined. Bitter, but determined.

Once I fixed all of the attachments and refactored some variables and tested them in-game, I realized the server admin from INS Miltia is having problems with this new update, so i sent him a couple of changes to the weapon attachment variables at the website forum. He thanked me, but he never got around to implementing the fixes for reasons unknown at the time. While I waited, I cleaned and organized the entire file to look more readable and consistent with plenty of comments to guide me when I read it.

I felt it was somewhat ready to open to the public so INS Militia players and I can have a place to play considering that INS Militia had not implemented these new updates from the devs and was not up as a result.

One of the guys from INS Militia played on my server a lot, but he reported a lot of crashes. And other INS Miltia players reported that they cannot join because they cannot download the theater file. It was puzzling how some people can join and download the theater file while other cannot. To fix the crashes, I found out some Linux commands to check the memory usage and apparently I needed more RAM. I upgraded the server to have 2x more RAM (1GB), and that seemed to fix it. Not having problems joining my server was a big deal. To a player, it can be have a big negative impression in server reliability. Originally, the way I served my own custom theater file was to just have it present in the right folder for the server itself to use. I found out about something called fast download. I knew I had to implement the fast download I saw in the server configuration file once. For some reason, a client doesn't always successfully download the custom theater file on the server. Fast download requires a second server, and I didn't really want to spend more after already upgrading the RAM. I asked Ballou something about his theater files and he showed me a link to how he formatted his fast download directories to ensure that clients can download theater files. Then, I deduced that all it was was a server with a specific file path. I don't have to spend money for another server to act as a fast download when I can run an apache webserver on the same server as the game server and just copy the theater file and directory path as Ballou did. I also saw a place for custom maps inside this fast download folder containing the custom theater files ready to serve to clients. I installed the apache server with the correct path and didn't have anymore problems with players downloading the theater file and joining my server (you can't join a server if you can't download the theater file). I had to make sure that the theater file located in fast download and the one being used by the server are the same every time I updated a new theater file, though.

My next step was to add some custom maps now that I have fast download working. This required that I place the custom map in the folder the game uses to run the map and the folder in fast download. I also needed to include the map name and map game type in a mapcycle configuration file. I had to do this for about 12 custom maps I added. Later on, this number would be about 30.

The server ran nicely at this point. I had very little features to carry over from INS Militia by now.

-spectators and dead players can freely talk and chat with each other
-Allow 12 players to join

Originally, the server holds 8 players. INS Militia normally holds 12. We were in a game session one night, all of us in a voice over ip program called Team Speak, and we reached the max number of players, but more wanted to join. I remembered I left the plugin to increase the server lobby size from 8 and told them okay, give me 3 minutes. I almost panicked at what I had to do, but knew that I knew how to do it. 3 minutes was just too small, I thought, but I didn't want them to say, "I'll just go walk the dog and come back later". I needed to let the eight players--who is already in-game--know that I was about to bring the server down, bring the server down via putty, open filezilla, edit the server configuration file and change 8 to 12, then open another configuration file and change the number from 40 to 44 (because this number represents the players+number of bots set in the other configuration file and that I found this out via many trial and error attempts by counting the number of bots in my own listen server). 32 bots plus 8 = 40, but now it's going to be 32 bots plus 12, which is 44. Three minutes doesn't seem long, but when you have 8+ people in Team Speak waiting for you, every 10 seconds can seem like a minute for those waiting. I launched the server and immediately said "I'm done" while joining the server myself. Since the server is in SF, I joined pretty fast. At which point, I realized I forgot something. Although my current changes allowed 12 people to join, there needed to be 12 classes, and the number of classes is controlled by the theater file. This means I had to quickly tell them sorry, I forgot one minor thing and stopped the server. Not everyone picked up on my mistake and was saying how they're unable to connect and I quickly copy and pasted a new theater file, renamed it to the next numbered sequence, opened it and copy and pasted 4 additional rifleman classes, saved it, uploaded one to the server game folder, compressed it into a bz2 format for the fast download server, changed the server configuration file to read the new filename of the new theater file, save and reupload to filezilla, and start the server. Fixing this mistake took about 50 seconds, but total time was about 2 and a half minutes. Everyone joined successfully, and the server was now handling more than 8 players in-game. It was a good thing that I left the plugin to handle more players on the server sit there. 12 is actually a pretty good number of players. I've watched many games and 12 sometimes seems a bit too much, but it works; anything more is way too crowded. Seems like Spliffz from INS Militia knew the sweet spot, too.

I became quite comfortable with the server features at this point, but I was having so much fun providing players with a positive, fun experience that I was probably far from done.

Back on the topic of my theater file design, INS Militia has class-based roles, so not all weapons are available for each class. So a sniper class had access to some weapons that can use a high powered scope. Although I can see the appeal of having players fulfill a class's role by limiting them to class-based weapons, I disagree with this approach for a couple of reasons. I played on many servers and players almost never play their role. I certainly have been a victim of being the last few players to join and the only classes available were marksman and sniper on a close quarters map. Other times, I wanted to use a specific weapon but couldn't because it was locked to only a few classes that were already taken. I also find from watching people that players like having a lot of choices; specifically, they want guns--the more the better--even if the weapon doesn't differentiate in stats to another weapon in game. I gave every weapon available for the security team to all classes with the exception of the machine gun, C4, drum magazine, which is class based. The machine gun was really powerful in the game because it's all about mag size in this game since you might be bombarded with a lot of bots that appear around your corner, I don't want every player to have the ability to deal with that situation; this is a team game, after all. Even though it takes into account that bots die in about 1-3 shots, there may be 15 bots that you have to deal with. Every class was the same, so every player won't feel left out. They'll have lots of choices and lots of replayability.

Players really seem to like this because they never really have to worry about being the last player to join. They've personally told me they really like not being locked to a limited number of weapons because someone else picked the class that have the weapons they want to use.

Even though I opened every gun/attachment/item for all classes, I encountered something I just had to limit. There was a drum mag for a new weapon that the game developers released in an update and everyone used it to the point where every other gun became obselete. I limited to one class to use the drum mag, and two classes to have access to the machine gun and drum mag for the new weapon. The players were a little bummed at not having it anymore, but I strongly felt it was a necessary change because players shouldn't have one weapon to be the best choice. Players should feel conflicted to choose from an array of weapons and items and choose based on what they feel may be the better one for them in a specific situation/map/easy or difficult to use/mood/playstyle.

You can now look at the github page I have and I'll be going over some of the changes there.

A player requested a semi-auto fire for the machine gun and I felt that it was a harmless change. There is a real-life counterpart for this feature, too, so I found and adjusted the value in the theater file.

I remember playing on Jared Ballou's server and seeing how there was no weapon sway on his weapons when aiming down the sights. I found the entries in his theater file and copied it over to mine. I didn't really like the random number generation for shooting as the weapon sway was quite excessive. Removing weapon sway unfortunately also removes the increased sway when being suppressed by the enemy, when your character is out of stamina, and it nullified the use of a bipod. I wish the no sway characteristic only applied to a player when he is not under suppressive fire.

A player wanted to enable the slide feature again, but I and other players have found it to hinder out gameplay when we try to sprint to crouch behind cover only to inadvertantly slide right past the cover, so I left it disabled.

I thought noclip was already available for the administrators, but I had to figure out the rules in SourceMod to enable all administrators to have the correct key value combination to have that function in the admin menu.

I wanted to add more weapon variety to the player's loadout so I added the insurgent shotgun. Submachine guns and shotguns were moved to the secondary slot because of their lowered stopping power compared to the rifles. The shotguns in particular were probably the worst weapons to use because if you missed one shot, you had to wait for the pump action. By that time, an enemy using a pistol or rifle will have gotten about 6 shots into you.

Instead of having 2 primary slots, i opted for a less powerful loadout and chose to add two secondary slots. I also removed the 3 additional explosive slots because it was getting in the way of the gameplay. Too much time is spent towards cycling through the explosive slots; it was too cluttered. I found it to be a major hindrance during gameplay.

I set the rules to pop up in chat at a specific interval to avoid cluttering the chat window and allow players to notice real chat messages, but the frequency needed to be increased so admins can refer new players to it. There were always players that to be reminded frequently unfortunately. I also had to clarify certain points because there are always players that will find some misunderstanding within the listed rules.

These may be small changes, but they all add up.

A player really wanted to have a rifle in the secondary slot. I didn't want this because it would mean the player will be able to have two primaries, which is quite powerful. It would also mix up the secondary slot weapons by having the only rifle in there. I did it to see how it would turn out.

I added 20 more maps because more variety will be fun for players as they aren't playing on the same maps over and over. I spent many hours playing on INS Militia, and I made sure to pick out only the maps that INS Militia played mostly on. I left out the ones that we avoided or talked poorly of. Originally, the maps on my fastdl server was in a compressed format. I noticed that compressing the maps have pros and cons. I concluded that uncompressed were best for my situation. Compressed maps may be smaller in file size and therefore faster for players to download, but if their CPU is slow, it will take a while to decompress. The decompression process shows as a frozen loading bar when the player is waiting to download it during a map change. It also has the benefit of occupying less disk space on the server. I heard several times that players think their game froze at the loading screen, so abandon all attempts to join the server. This was poorly handled by whatever was involved in not showing what the loading bar was actually doing. Whether it is true or not that it froze or if it's actually in the middle of decompressing the file is unknown to me, but not having explicit status updates on the loading screen is not helpful to the user. Uncompressed files on the other hand takes up more space on my server. Since I had space, I opted for uncompressed files. The loading status bar is less ambiguous as a result with uncompressed map files being served from fast download. Downloading the map actually has a loading bar, so players know that when their download is completed, they can join the server shortly. I noticed fewer people having issues loading maps now. It seems that more people have fast internet than a fast CPU capable of decompressing a maximum decompressed file. And so, I didn't have problems with players trying to join anymore.

Some maps were not working as there were many versions of these maps and the version naming system wasn't intuitive, so I had to disable or change some versions of maps like shellshock, which didn't work. Difficulty was hard to adjust as there are many ways to approach this. Currently, all the bots are the same template that I copied and pasted from one section in the default theater file because I have been focusing 90 percent of my time on other parts of the theater file. I added a machine gunner to act as the heavy weapons guy to watch out for. He also has heavy armor whose settings and loadout I imported from the default elite theater file that came with the game. I increased the bot count to 36 when the server is full to increase the difficulty. I tried to give the bots more points to use for the new attachments I added in the theater file, but I don't think the AI makes use of the attachments, so I removed it.

One new weapon added by the update was actually the security variant of the same weapon found on the insurgent side. I couldn't get the security version of the 7x scope on there, but the insurgent one worked, so I went with that. I disabled the radio filter in the server configuration file because it made our comms more difficult to interpret. We had the option to use INS Militia's Team Speak server anyways and that doesn't have an audio filter. I enabled voice across players and spectators since this is mostly a PVP concern. It would allow semi-AFK players to continue to engage in the conversation while they're sitting back or multitasking.

There have been several instances where a player goes AFK, and becomes the last man standing. The admin can slay the player from the menu but this meant that the admins had to do this every round, so I found a plugin that allowed an admin to move them to spectator mode. I didn't want to kick them because there can be many reasons that doesn't deserve a negative response for AFKing.

I felt pretty good about the weapon/item/explosive loadout, so I spent my time now on the bot variety. The bots so far were all operating with the same weapon and template (because I copy-pasted). I felt that the players and I will become bored, encountering the same bot all the time. There wasn't any kind of visual surprise/analysis from a player when they see a bot. I sought to change this by studying how the bot loadouts worked in the theater file--something I never got to until now.

There were just plenty of insurgent weapons and items to throw in the mix. I made sure to take advantage of this as best I can with the limited behavior that the AI was programmed to do. I made several different classes and gave each class a different insurgent weapon. There also had to be one with an RPG. Each class can also carry a throwable, so I had to make sure every bot had a good frequency of a specific type of throwable. The frequency also changes by the number of times the bots spawns, so I have about 8 classes that need to fill the 36 slots. This arrangement was difficult as well because you can't have too many machine gunners spawn in. You should have just the right amount of bots that have RPGs, right amount of snipers, right amount of machine gunners, etc. The only way to determine if a throwable or class was used too much was to just play the game for a while and watch how the bots behave and how the player reacts to the bot spawn type numbers. If I recall correctly, the default theater puts 2 bots with RPGs. I tried adding one more and it was instant KO to almost the entire team. That wasn't fun. The players will have, by default in my custom theater, heavy armor, so they're not as likely to die in 1 or 2 shots but instead 2-4. I felt that the original value was too little to be considered fun. It becomes almost frustrating for the player to have almost no chance to flee, and I want the player to have that feeling of being really lucky they survived, but not all the time. All the time would mean the player won't learn from their mistakes and say to themselves they should have been more cautious around that corner, or that they were being too careless. I wanted a more balanced approach. INS Militia already have heavy armor as default for players, but heavy armor didn't always feel any different than not having armor at all. I wanted to take this further. I did this by removing all armor piercing ammo from the bot loadout (you can choose AP, HP, stock ammo in this game). It worked really well. Players can still die by 1-2 shots, but the frequency was lowered. Instead, they can take about 2-3 shots. It gives the player a small fighting chance without sacrificing the player becoming a bullet sponge. That small fighting chance gives players satisfaction, knowing they have a small window to survive if they play smart, while punishing careless players. The only class that has AP ammo was the sniper bot because players were surviving multiple sniper rifle shots, which i think was unbalanced--the sniper and machine gunner class should be the surprise twist mid-round and they should encourage the player to be cautious when encountered. I also added a "curve ball" by having a bot carry a suppressed version of an insurgent weapon. This is due to audio cues being very useful in the game because when someone hears an insurgent weapon fire, they know it's an insurgent and what the direction it's coming from if they have stereo sound. This suppressed variant class adds another layer of depth to the bots that players encounter. Layers serve to push the player to adapt to different situations and keep the game from being mundane.

I originally gave the bots a pistol in case they empty their clips, but the bot's AI chose to use pistols when a certain distance is met against the player based on my observation. This wasn't working because bots are typically within this specified distance and the bots ended up using the pistols more often than the rifle I gave them. Like, when we first initiate contact with the enemy, they'll have their pistols out. That's not how I wanted it to work. They had to be half-way across the map to switch to their primary.

As the server became more popular, a noticeable lag occurred when the bots spawn in and that caused the CPU to go from average 40% to 95% when I looked at the server monitor page, so I opted to scale up the server. There was a slight improvement, but I don't think it was worth twice the price, so that was shortlived.

I had to increase the objective deteriorate time, players will often try to clear the objective and every player that passes through the objective or help clear it, only adds to the amount. This doesn't include the new players that try to sit on the objective before being told the rules and to step off. It now reset immediately when all players step off the cap zone. When any player stands in a designated cap zone of a map, a ticker will fill and bots will spawn in.

I played around with the minimum number of bots in the server because in the day time, a couple of older INS Militia members play and I thought that the difficulty became too hard for them since only a few of them play compared to almost a full server later in the day. This proved later to be somewhat ineffective as I notice players like to kill a lot of bots as opposed to playing with harder but fewer bots.

I disabled the respawn feature for admins because it was being used way too much. I noticed that death no longer had any value in the game when the admins would just push a button to respawn everyone back. Originally, they had to go through the clunky admin menu to bring a single person back, but they saw me use a console command binded to a single key and I gave it to them when they asked for it. They would press it immediately when they die and then rush back to the front lines and die again. I informed the admins of this change and why I did it and they felt the same. However, they still wanted it because they said sometimes toxic players will team kill and leave for example. I reinstated it and now the admins only use it when the morning crew plays in small numbers, but stops using it when more people join. I couldn't find a better way to handle this. I tried to find a way to limit the amount of admins to be able to use that command in the Source Mod files, but I couldn't find it. Having death be meaningful in the game is important because it encourages the player to play more cautiously and to take it slow. It also encourages teamwork. In INS Miltia, players that die also engage or start a conversation and they also cheer for the remaining alive player(s). They also try and help the last remaining players because they can operate a 3rd person camera to help watch behind the player. This "clutch" factor I feel is important to the social aspect of the game as I have observed it before the "respawn all humans with one key press" feature was known to be available. 

While browsing the security classes section in the theater file, I wanted to add more variety to the security classes. It was mostly just a required leader class, riflemans, and 2 support. I wanted to add a few more classes that look different. Although the default game theater has this, there are some overlapping skins. I wanted to make it so that I know exactly what class someone is playing just by seeing what skin they have. It didn't serve that much of a purpose since most classes in-game can use the same weapons except for machine gunner. The game allows a bit of combination because some classes can have a cap or helmet. Then i realized that there is an escort vip mode in player vs player mode, so why not bring the VIP skin in. Then i remember, I can also do this for the bots too. The VIPs definitely look cooler and adds more variety to the server.

I wanted to add some female classes for some of the small number of female regulars that play in the server. I tried looking for a female character skin, but no one made any in the workshop--a location to download mods to your game governed by Steam and the community.

I wanted players to make more of their shots count--to encourage careful shots and not just spray in one direction. I did this by decreasing the magazines that players can carry. This was met with a lot of negative reaction. Instead, i didn't find players doing what I hoped, so I changed it back. I realized it was also unrealistic because one of the admins--a marine--says he carried around 7 magazines during his deployment.

I disabled the secondary 2 slot and instead added a primary 2 slot similar to INS Militia to see the reaction from the players. I typically don't ask what the players think of changes. I just go into the game and take note of the reaction across different players, noting how each person I've played with feels about it, including opinions from new people who join the server. I feel that asking for what they think generates a slightly different answer. It's difficult to explain, but if you make what is regarded as a slight "nerf", it's still a "nerf" and it's a bad/negative thing, and people don't want any amount of negative things.

I enabled a ReflectTK plugin to prevent team killers from killing a teammate. It's a common issue because this server actually enforces its rules, and those rules are going against what just about every other server is like out there: run and gun. I paired this plugin with a 100% friendly fire damage output CVAR command, and it just resulted in a lot of accidents. In addition to weapon firing accidents, there is the very common issue of triggering an accidental team attack when detonating C4 to ambush the bots' counter-attack, and C4 damage radius and values were increased in the theater file to more accurately represent their explosive capability in real life. By default, the server also kicks a player if they teamkill after several times, which resulted in a lot of regulars being punished for accidents. I ultimately removed this plugin and set friendly fire to 50%. Regular players just try their best to watch firing lanes.

I didn't like that the game considers 2 players within proximity to activate a bot to fire an rpg. It forced players to be too spread out. I couldn't flank with a friend without fearing of being KO-ed together in one RPG hit. Bunching up a minimum of 3 players felt more appropriate. I changed this value in the server configuration file but the bots didn't fire RPGs at all, so I reverted it to the default 2. 

Some players don't have a fast PC, fast internet, or both. This means that when a new map loads, that player will load in during a time when the player spawn window has closed, and that they'd have to wait for the round to end (all alive players die). Luckily, there was an option that specifically handled this issue. I changed this by altering the first round of the map to have a longer timer, and subsequent rounds will have a shorter time. That way, people who have been in the game after 1 round for example, won't have to wait long since they've already loaded the map, and their entire loadout is carried over from round 1.

After becoming familiar with how the theater file worked, I resolved a bug I noticed in INS Militia. I found that in INS Militia, you cannot use the "X" button to remove the weapons from your loadout most of the time. I eventually found out that it is likely due to the nature of making the weapon/items weight nothing or cost nothing to purchase. I believe it has something to do with the game recognizing and changing a positive value to a zero value. So when you have a zero value change to a zero value, the game doesn't register that as a change and therefore doesn't show the immediate removal of an item when "X" is selected. I added a cost of 1 to every weapon/item and it fixed this issue. I would later on fix this issue for INS Militia's server when I was helping out with their theater file.

The resupply penalty timer was increased because this prevented players from standing in the spawn point and firing AT4/RPG and immediately resupplying to do it over again.

I found that the grenade launchers actually have only 1 round and fixed this. I also didn't want to give up all my explosive slots just for grenade launchers, which means that if you choose a grenade launcher on the M16, your explosive slots are now disabled. Sometimes I want to have a grenade launcher with a smoke grenade. It took a while to find this value but I got it. It was an interesting workaround I had to figure out in the theater file.

I had tried having two secondaries, then I had tried two primaries, then went back to two secondaries. Then I had the idea while looking at the vest section of the theater file. There are two vests, one light and one heavy. There's no point in using the light vest since I removed the weight and currency system. I know that if i remove the vest, then i also remove the primary 2 slot. This means I can have the heavy vest enable primary 2 slot, but disable the secondary 2 slot and the 3rd explosive slot, while the light vest will enable 2 secondary and enable the 3rd explosive slot. Having 2 primary slots with 3 explosive slots seems too powerful, so 2 secondaries with 3 explosives is more reasonable. It worked, I now have the option of having both versions and didn't have to choose one or the other or enable all of them at once, which would've been too much. The heavy armor values were copied over to the light armor so players weren't actually losing the benefit of heavy armor.

In order to discourage too many players from using the weapon with the drum mag, I made it weigh a lot. Weight causes the player to run slower and the weapon to sway more if stamina is low (a feature I reinstated). This didn't seem to affect any of the players. They still all used it, so I removed the weight factor and instead limited only to a specialist and 2 support classes. Players no longer only used the Galil SAR with drum mag. Players were sad about the change but they got used to it, and there was a greater distribution of weapons used afterwards, which was important, as each weapon felt different and had advantages/disadvantages.

Although most people opt for a submachine gun in the secondary, the pistol still has the slight benefit of low recoil, easy handling, and maximum visibility (an actual important aspect, really). Submachines still have a slight kick in recoil, medium visibility. I observed a good balance of weapons being used in both primary and secondary weapons. The weapons I rarely see anyone use are the shotguns. The firerate is abysmal and near useless going up against an automatic or even a pistol. I came up with an idea to change it somehow. I looked into the weapon properties and saw that I can change the fire rate for each weapon (semi automatic, burst, and full auto). I changed the shotgun to full auto, but decreased the firerate until it matched one of the real life automatic shotguns, not before trying out an insanely high fire rate that unleashed 15 shotgun shells in half a second of course. I had two shotguns to improve, so I had to make sure that two of them are different. I needed only a couple variables to make sure both weapons are different enough to choose one or the other. Based on the weapon properties in the theater file, I can see that I can change the clip size, the rate of fire, and the recoil. I had to scrap the Benelli XM autoshotgun I originally had in mind because I couldn't find another real life shotgun that could fit its counterpart with different stats. I needed a shotgun with low recoil and low ammo count and another with higher ammo count and higher recoil. Rate of fire was almost the same according to specs on the internet. The two shotguns that fit these two descriptions were the AA-12 and the Saiga-12. While the end result still wasn't very often used, it held its own when compared to the other secondary weapons, and that was my primary goal. Shotguns are mainly a room clearing type of weapon and it now serves that very well. The recoil was difficult to get right because there are about 8 different handling variables. Horizontal pull to left/right, vertical pull to left/right, time to reset blowback to center aim--I had to test all of these variables in-game to see what each were doing in-game.  The game lowers recoil depending on the player standing or crouching, leaning, and two modes of walking to mix all that together. I had to make sure the recoil wasn't too much to discourage players from using it, but I had to make sure it was still viable within a certain distance while the player was either crouched and not moving, crouched and moving, standing still, standing and moving, etc.

Another problem was a player was sniping with the shotgun using slugs. I knew I could adjust values relating to the effectiveness distance of ammo, but this was an area of the game that isn't very clear on its values. The Source engine seems to get mixed results here and testing my changes is impractical. I would require the same bullet be shot to a frozen bot who has his arms out (to not accidentally shoot his arms because of weird hitboxes) and receive a damage indicator. The best I could do is prevent the bots from walking, and that's it (I believe I turned on an invisible cheat on my character to achieve this). I had to do a haphazard way of just lowering the distance number until I felt that after many tests, keeping in mind whether my target has body armor or not, the shotgun was not really effective around 90 yards (or was it meters). I forget which unit it was but I was told by the marine that the effective range of a slug is really about that distance.

I remembered in one of the night modes in PvP, players have access to flares, which disrupt nightvision. I tried to figure out what use I could get out of adding flares to the coop, and then I remember the guys mentioned different colored smoke. Colored smoke can be used to identify areas of interest, and I brought the flare into the game for the VIP and Leaders. Players could abuse this but since there are always admins on the server, I figured it wouldn't be a problem. The result was that no one really ever used it except me. They knew what it was, but it took up the first explosive slot, and it was rarely used as a colored smoke item. There are however rare moments when it was useful. After a counter attack, the dead players will respawn in an area different from the captured point, and this respawn area changes as we move around the map capturing points; it would be close, but not exactly on it, and after the dead players respawn, that same area is used as a resupply area, which alive players now need for the counterattack, but don't know where it is. This is where the flare shines. I tell them to look for it as I'm about to fire it into the air. I was so happy to switch from spectator to a player and immediately make use of this feature. Before the flares, they usually just guided each other around the map with verbal communication, but for me now, a silent jubilation.

At the end of the map, the last checkpoint is twice as long and has two counter attack waves. Often times, I see players eliminate all the bots before the second wave and they'll sit there and wait. I wanted to change this to have a higher frequency of bot respawns so no time is wasted waiting around. The bots should hit hard and fast during the finale--a final, great climactic end to the map. I solved this by decreasing the bot respawns from one minute down to 20 seconds. I also increased the regular counter attack times so players can fight longer.

The revolver is another weapon added in a recent update that just plain sucks. Just like the shotguns, it has a terrible firing rate. Even worse, it has only 6 bullets. If you aren't carrying the fast reload, the player will reload one bullet at a time. The one thing I thought I could change is the power. If it has a terrible firing rate, long reload and small magazine, then it should be balanced by an incrediblly powerful single shot. Unfortunately, this dealt with the same area of the weapon that handles damage and distances, and the results were too random. Either it was too powerful or too weak. Slowly adjusting values didn't work either as those gave mixed results as well. It was also said to be really unrealistic when compared to a powerful revolver in real life because accuracy would be really, really bad, and at that point, the weapon wasn't going to be a good choice to use anymore. I reverted it back to the default weapon, and left it alone.

During the final counter attack wave, the dead players actually spawn in so everyone can participate in the last checkpoint's counter attack, and then the bots spawn a set number of seconds after. I set the number for the bots to spawn in too fast after players spawn in, and the newly spawned players would have bots spawn right next to them. I lengthened the time to fix this. It couldn't be too long or else players would be waiting, and it couldn't be too fast because of the problem listed above. A good number is one that keeps the players on alert to rush back with the alive team, while not making the alive team wait too long to be able to shoot bots from their position.

In order to make the gameplay more slow paced, I adjusted the movement speed. I felt the movement speed was too fast. Bots can also sometimes zig zag/juke along their predestined path and evade your shots. The movement was one of the game's highlights because there are several different movement speeds: sprint, speedwalk, speedwalk while aiming down weapon sights, speedwalk while leaning, crouch speedwalk, crouch walk, crouch aim down sight speedwalk, crouch aim down sight walk, etc. All have a different speed. Basically, a lean, or weapon aim down sight lowered the speed just a bit in addition to whatever stance the player is in. I had to keep this in mind while I test the lowered movement speeds. I also had to take into consideration that some maps are a lot larger than others so it can't be too slow, and it can't be too fast for smaller, indoor maps.

I added a cvar to make weapons from dead entities (players or bots) to stay longer instead of disappearing, but only recently disabled it (2016-03-01) because it might be causing more lag on the server. Or maybe the lag was due the latest game patch.

While browsing through Reddit about whether or not the developers were going to improve the AI, I noticed Jared Ballou commented on a post about improving AI, and that he has his own custom values on his github. I looked at it and implemented into my server. After testing for several months, I can't really say that it is better or worse; it's just a different type of AI. It definitely removes the aimbot-like behavior of the bots, which is great, but there are times when the AI just fails to hit even one shot out of the 30 shots fired at point blank. After the latest update, I removed it because the bots aim towards the sky sometimes or maybe that was because of the latest update. I can't really be sure of anything. Tests keep end up with no obvious result. I did carry over a cvar that made the bots shoot at a minimum of 3 seconds vs the default 1 second. The result was they became more aggressive, which gave me another way to increase difficulty.

This next change is my absolute favorite idea because its implementation fulfilled exactly how I thought it might be used in-game: replace bots' smoke grenades with molotovs. Originally, bots throwing a lot of smoke grenades means our vision is obscured in a given area--giving the players a disadvantage. While true for the previous patches in which the bots could see through the smoke and players couldn't, it was changed to the opposite. Even with this change, I thought smoke would be a good factor in disorienting the player, but the smoke actually provides a huge benefit to players. The bots would throw it in an area (often the choke point where players are waiting in position) they are about to navigate to and as they walk into the smoke and approach the smoke's outer radius, the players can see and attack the bots before the bots can detect players and attack us. This effectively made the bots walk in a near single file line to a firing squad. The AI was dumb enough, and the smoke made them even moreso. So, I removed it and thought about raining hellfire on the players with molotovs. I know molotovs can obscure vision in an area a bit just like smoke, but the bots can definitely see over the flames, so it was almost like a replacement for smoke grenades. I also thought how great it would be if the molotovs were used to block players from progressing through a certain area--which is actually how this item should be used by players, but I don't think the AI was programmed to do this. I observed the bots using smoke grenades defensively--but never throwing it onto the players. The bots treat the grenade and molotov throws differently: a grenade will land right on your head or right next to you out of nowhere and you die because they throw a perfect arc even from a close distance. You could be standing a few meters away and they can throw a perfect ellipse. When we wait for the counter attack, we played the maps enough times to know which direction the bots are coming from, so we get into our position and wait. Molotovs would hopefully prevent this by breaking our formation when a molotov lands in the middle of our group. So, now the molotov does several things to provide a more dynamic type of gameplay: it keeps players on their toes; it can prevent a player from progressing through a preferred route; it can obscure the player's vision and provide the bot with a slight advantage; it breaks player formations, thus cause a players to panic; and it prevents players from getting too comfortable with monotomous gameplay. It's early implementation yielded good results, but there were occasional problems. First is that the AI has perfect aim. Over several games, I noticed a player's frustration from dying from a molotov because of their perfect aim. I thought that it was because the initial burn from the molotov removed the last few remaining amount of health from an already weakened player. The molotov fire normally hurts in increments until the player's health is depleted, but there have been several times where I hear the player say they died because the molotov landed on them with full health. I thought maybe they just didn't notice their health was depleted a bit. Then one time, I was next to a newly spawned player and saw a molotov land and kill the player instantly. I thought there must be a different value that handles a perfectly aimed molotov hit. I asked the former developer if he knew of a value like that, but he said he didn't know. It took some searching in several theater files until I found something, though. It's exactly what I was looking for. There is a "perfect hit" key and value. Realistically, it should instant kill, and it's value in PvP is warranted, but the AI is too good at getting perfect molotov hits, so I decreased it down to the same value as a regular burn as if the player stepped in the fire. I also decreased the fire damage a bit so as not to kill the player too fast. Its value is big enough to discourage running through, but small enough to allow the player to realize that they've just been hit with a molotov (even with a player's health starting around 70%) and they need to move out of the damaging area. This area of the theater file also allowed me to enlarge the burn radius and lengthen the time of the fire on the ground, which helps extend all the nice things the molotov does against players. The results in-game are great. It nailed on every point I listed above, and it even affected the way I play because I was getting too comfortable with my positioning. It stopped me from going in one direction that could have given me an amazing flank against the bots. I got frustrated at my own implementation, and that's a good thing.

I rearranged the frequency of certain throwables by the bots to adjust for difficulty and frustation factor (grenades landing next to players and instant KO). The bots don't carry a lot of grenades because evading a perfectly thrown grenade is quite difficult. I keep it there to change up the gameplay a bit because although it often results in a perfect throw, it acts as a much faster version of the molotov. This means that the player should actively listen for the sound effect of a grenade landing near them and immediately sprint away or around a corner, or even yell "grenade" to their teammates. The result I've seen is that some players don't hear/see it (understandable as some regulars' reflexes just aren't that great), and some do. I've been next to a player and we both see/hear it and it's pretty funny when we both react the same way by doing a 180 and sprinting away. I keep the bot grenade carry count low, though.

Apparently, increasing the counterattack time was a bad idea because players would clear out the bots quite fast and they're left with waiting for the timer to end. This also means the dead players have to wait a bit longer, too. I set it back closer to the original 1 minute counter attack, but added about 10 seconds. This 10 seconds allowed me to adjust another value. The bots don't actually spawn immediately when the timer hits zero; there is a value that handles how long after the 1 minute countdown to spawn the bots. I added about 12 seconds and had the bots spawn in after about 7 seconds. I felt this 7 seconds gives the players to get back to a specific spot to defend the checkpoint. This also gives the bots the remaining 5 seconds to appear out of "thin air" and orient themselves on the map's navigation path, which provides somewhat of a "true" 1 minute counter attack. I had to spectate several games to get the timing right, observing both players and bots as they spawned in.

I added a bot name prefix to easily differentiate the bots from the player names. Sometimes, a player will have the same name as the bot if the player uses an English name with correct capitalization. This also helps when using administrative commands because the system needs to differentiate the two. Otherwise, I can't execute admin commands on a person with the same name as a bot or vice versa.

C4 detonating other C4 nearby was disabled because it just meant most players weren't able to detonate their C4 after the first player does it. The C4 has a 50 meter activation radius, so players will often put it near each other. I don't think detonating C4 detonates C4 in its proximity in real life either; it appears to be detonated by a really high electrical current. I may reinstate this because C4 became too overpowered. I already decreased its effectiveness, but this might help take it a bit further without sacrificing the effective radius to one that doesn't really set itself apart from a grenade. This would be in addition to removing the item from the 3 classes that can use a drum mag/machine gun. Having a machine gun/drum mag plus C4 is too much.

I added a rule not to "prime" the cache. The cache is a checkpoint that triggers a counterattack (spawn enemies) or finale counterattack and requires either a molotov, an RPG, or 2 grenades to trigger. Some players like to throw one grenade at it so they will also get points and have their name on the "x captured objective" when a cache is destroyed. There have been several times when a player tries to prime the cache only to find out that they just blew up the cache and triggered the counter attack while teammates were in the killzone, which breaks server rules. This is because caches can be accidentally primed during a firefight from the previous checkpoint's second wave of bots that are spawned to defend this upcoming cache.

In my continuing attempt to find the best difficulty--one that doesn't make the game too easy or too difficult, I allowed the option for users to change the difficulty in the middle of the game. I also adjusted each bot class's weapon and throwable loadout including the frequency of spawn by listing each class (one that carries molotovs will be listed 6 out of 32 times for example) a certain number of times out of the total 32 lines of bot variables in the theater file. This can be coupled with Jared Ballou's bots, which deals with the aimbot-like behavior, and can adjust its reaction time based on the in-game difficulty number that primarily focuses on decreasing time to acquire a player target by a bot. Also, number of bots spawned based on number of players is another aspect of adjusting difficulty.

I realized that while I can put a VIP on the security side, there exists one on the insurgent side, too.

I like to watch players play most of the time, so I added an extra slot just for a spectator. If I wanted to add another player, I'd have to add this in the theater file which requires an update to an additional 3 files on the server.

Some maps are night maps, which automatically gives players the option to use an accessory to use night vision goggles. However, some day maps have dark areas, so I customized the theater file to accept NV goggles. This helps reinforce the philosophy of the server to give the player more choices.

When the round is over, the game will display a screen to allow players to vote for the next map. All custom maps will only show the name and not the picture. The stock maps have a picture so it's easy to identify which map the player is looking at. I've seen only one server do this, so I know it at least can be done. I searched a long time, but only found a way for the client to show those images, which requires downloading a zip file, extracting it, and placing them in a correct path in the Insurgency game folder: it's fast and reliable and doesn't interfere with anything, but that meant telling every single person on the server to do it. I doubt they'd want to do it the work involved, even if it's not hard to do; i believe they shouldn't have to put in any effort, and it shouldn't be this way.

I thought, if the game loads customized content based on a path, is there any way for me to have the server serve files in a similar fashion to the theater files (because theater files are placed in a specific path of the fast download server and the user downloads it to their insurgency game folder/scripts/theater). I tried putting it on my fast download server in different configurations but it didn't work.

Then I thought about how that would be too easy. Then it hit me, I've used GFScape to extract the theater files and those vpk files were in a specific path, so something like cloning a directory path might be doable if I put these files into a vpk file with the same directory structure.

I never uploaded or participated in creating mod content on the workshop, so I had to learn how to do that without much documentation again. Not only was it a learning process to upload the content, but to allow the server to use mod content from the workshop and connect to that specific mod that I created. I initially couldn't get it working and it was really frustrating because I checked my work over and over, but eventually found out that it was because I had to make the mod public. I made it private because I just needed it listed on the workshop for my server to see it, but I can't specifically allow it to see only my server. If other people subscribe to it, it wouldn't do anything for them because those servers aren't serving my mod. It worked immediately when I changed it to public. Nice pictures for nearly all maps. I say nearly all because that zip file that I had to download originally had old versions of map images and names. I tried opening them in a text editor and I saw that vmt files are readable. I then Googled how to open vmt files and it can be opened with a photo editor. All I did next was to see if there was an outdated vmf and vmt file and just rename the filenames to the updated mapname (badel_coop_v1 to badel_coop_v2 for example), and I opened the vmt file and saw the map name in there and renamed that as well. I used a program to package that all into a vpk like the first time, and reuploaded it onto the workshop and it worked. I realized I also now have the process of being able to create new images for new maps that weren't a part of the zip file. I could simple copy and paste an existing one and rename the three parts of the map name and then take a screenshot of the map in-game and save that as a vmf file.

I figured out this whole ordeal with the custom map pictures, but I also noticed a beginning of a player here and there being unable to join the server from some error from which google results gave no resolution. I ultimately disabled it and players no longer had any trouble joining. Because I have over 60 custom maps in comparison to the ~8 stock maps with pictures, it was more important for all players to have no difficulty joining than having a good picture to know which map they're going to play next.

For a while now, the server cannot stay on constantly; it might crash during the middle of the night when no one is on, or after a certain period of time. I wanted to figure out a way to keep the server up so i don't have to depend on one of my players to keep telling me when it goes down and then i have to remote connect to the server and execute a command to start the server again. I didn't know if the Linux game server manager that I was using had that feature, so I thought what happens if I type the server start command while the server has already started. I've tried this accidentally and it will just tell you that the server is already running. Then I thought, as long as the system knows it is currently running and does nothing, then I can execute that command every minute as a way to check if the server is running. 

This led me to learn about crontabs. After many google searches on the subject and looking at cronjob. I couldn't get it working. My bin/bash code was correct; I double checked my script commands by using them directly in terminal and it worked, but the cronjob just wouldn't execute. I put this task aside for a while.

A few days later, I was at work trying to fix an issue regarding the backup of our application to another server. Apparently, the backup wasn't executing a specific cronjob to backup and zip a folder. My supervisor and I tried to execute the script commands in the terminal and they all worked fine. Then I tried to remove more and more commands from the script to see if it could execute something more basic to see if the problem lied in certain areas of the code. It still didn't work. This backup process was done by another contractor, by the way. Then I told my supervisor to create a file straight from the command line and save it there; it might be something related to Windows and Linux. And it worked. We went back to check the problematic file and when we saved via the nano editor, it shows a [DOS] word appended to the filename. The original file immediately worked when we recreated the script using only Linux. I suspect that the contractor that worked on this created the script in Windows and carried it over to Linux which caused the problem in crontab. Then I thought, well maybe this is the same problem I have on my server, so I went back home after that day, I checked and it was. I had used Sublime Text on Windows and that caused the problem.

Now that my script runs, it was also adding to a log file that it executed this. Because I wanted it to run every minute, that system log file was going to be huge. I had to figure out how to disable that in Linux after more Google searching but again it just somehow didn't work for me even thought I followed all the instructions correctly. Someone mentioned off-topic that it was a service and then I realized that it probably needs to be restarted. I googled the command to restart that particular service and then it worked immediately.

In addition to running a server start command, I wanted it to output the results into a specific log file I created, so I can look at it once in a while and see if the server actually crashed. I figured that out, but it didn't have a timestamp. After being unable to figure out how to append a timestamp to the same cronjob, I figured I could add another cronjob and concatenate the current system time and add a carriage return to the same file and that worked. Later on, it seems that the server crashes after a certain period of time on INS Militia too for unknown reasons; I was told by a player that it was because the developers don't care about the game and this was one of the many things they're doing wrong.

For fun, I thought about what I could do with the firing rate for another weapon like i did with the shotgun. I could definitely use those on pistols, as there are automatic pistols in real life. I chose to make the automatic glock. I tried to match the magazine size to reflect the real life version as well as the recoil. The recoil was a bit difficult as I learned to adjust more values here than I did with the shotgun. This is because of the really fast fire rate and recoil of the pistol, and that gave a more challenging approach than compared to the shotgun. I had watched YouTube videos on it and it was useable to some extent for some people, but perhaps I can make it only viable in that similar fashion in-game when the player is crouched and not moving. After many trials, I felt comfortable with the result. It isn't a weapon I needed to have, nor was it something I didn't want to use; it was something I would use if I wanted to have some fun that could clear a room in close quarters, and I felt I got that out of my recoil and magazine values. I wanted to make sure that this automatic pistol doesn't compete with other pistols or submachine guns while in the secondary slot because I felt there was enough variety in the secondary slot options. This automatic glock stood on its own as a high visibility, accurate first shot but terrible recoil on the subsequent shots, short range high firepower and emptied its clip fast. It was like a hybrid of using a shotgun and submachine gun and pistol actually. You get the visibility of the pistol, the room clearing option of a shotgun and submachine gun, but the disadvantage of shortrange from a shotgun due to the recoil.

I thought I could change the knife somehow because I felt that it was quite useless. The game requires you to knife twice to get kill, which makes it so players wouldn't run around with a knife to get kills. One can kill by a single hit from a knife by knifing a bot from behind but that never happens because the AI seems to have eyes behind their head. I found the damage output in the theater file and changed this to 100 instead of the default 70. I was cautious about this because of the whole running around knifing bots thing, but i wanted to see the effect. I hoped players would use it in a situation that does prop up from time to time when they've exhaused their primary and secondary as a last man standing, with bots still coming around the corner. This allowed the player to still have a fighting chance to get away--maybe a doorway that is blocked by a single bot from a back entrance to aid an escape. One player turned out to use it as a run and knife situation, so, so much for that. Then I thought, let's make the damage output 99. It'd still take two hits, but that's from a complete healthy bot. If you were the last man standing, there is a good chance that the bots' health aren't at 100 (but not quite dead yet either) from your teammates' efforts. This struck a good balance in my opinion. The results of this doesn't come very often at all but I have seen a couple instances where it worked from my gameplay, and it definitely stopped the run and knifing from that single player who did it.

The server got popular enough for me to test having a dedicated server to only host the fast download stuff, so i moved the fast download maps and theater files there. I also tested using a dual core server. While it did decrease the amount of stutter when bots spawned in (which apparently is the only time that the server uses the most CPU power at around 90%), it wasn't significant enough and i felt that this small benefit wasn't enough to warrant the double increase in the monthly payment amount.

Upgraded Server 1 to $20/mo but gameplay on heights_coop had a lot of stuttering. I wanted to keep the IP, so I backed up the necessary files onto my computer, reformatted, then rebuilt the server from the ground up. The stutter remained. I restored the server from a previous snapshot, and the stutter remained. I reverted back to the $10/mo pricing configuration, and the stutter still remained.

I started a new "droplet" as Server 2 with the $20/mo configuration and restored from a snapshot, and the stutter was gone. Then, I rebuilt the server from ground up without changing the pricing configuration, and the stutter was not as bad as Server 1, but existed nonetheless.

I started new a new "droplet" under the $20/mo configuration using a snapshot again, and the stutter was gone.

The only weapon the bots have that are AP rounds is the mosin--a sniper rifle. I noticed while spectating once that the mosin was shooting a player multiple times and he didn't die. The sniper bot should be feared for their sneaky and abruptly devastating attack, which I felt needed this change.

Spliffz, the server administrator for INS Militia messaged me to ask for my help on his servers. He said he has been busy talking to the game developers on their forums about documenting the game's updates. I offered to take a look at his theater file and fixed all the bugs that the updates introduced. Then I implemented the new weapons from the new updates and placed them in whatever slots he told me when i asked him. I also organized and commented many areas for the reader. I told him many things that players liked and things that I felt improved gameplay, hoping he might implement some things from my server. At the same time, I don't want to try and force him to change the classic server setup. He ultimately didn't use anything from my servers. After I finished the theater file, he had trouble implementing the theater file. There were several things that went wrong. He didn't place the theater file in his fast download; he said he didn't need to, but i know when I tried to use theater files without a fast download, half the people can join. Most of the time it didn't allow anyone to join. Once he got this done, it displayed a different error. I figured out that he changed the filename to all uppercase and told him to rename it; it worked afterwards. He showed me a lot about his server that was really fascinating. He's also a much more experienced programmer. My role was to ensure that the server runs without problems and make new changes to the theater file when an update occurs. He showed me some cool things about his server like hiding the directory folders and files inside that folder to prevent DDOS attacks on the server. I said I should have renamed the fast download path so people can't guess the folder name but he said that was futile because Google can cache the site and bots/people will be able to find it. He then prceeded to show me a link with the servers with their fast download folder containing the 60+MB map files. He also showed me how he uses a synchronizing script to handle changes he makes to the server so it would push/apply the changes to both the INS Militia servers. He said he disabled it because it was having problems. He also showed me how he was working on a feature that can start a server that loads a randomized map, instead of loading in the order of the mapcycle configuration file. While looking for bugs in his server, I found a map in the mapcycle that is no longer a coop map and he fixed that shortly after. I thought that map used to be coop but it's gone now; we both agreed. i asked if he had an older backup, and he did. It was a good night map so I don't know why the developers removed it. It turns out Spliffz also uses a similar setup to make sure the server is running every minute. He just uses the "./insserver monitor" command instead of the "./insserver start" that I use.

I saw a server implement a fast reload, fast holster and fast draw speed option. I only saw one server do this, and the person who created the theater file did not answer another forum user's question on how they acheived this. This server owner was actually subscribing to a theater file from the workshop. Because this was a workshop mod, the theater file doesn't actually save to the client's computer. So it doesn't appear in the theater folder in the game folder--meaning I can't see what the specific line of text that allows fast holster actions. I asked Jared Ballou and he said the speed is tied to the animation and couldn't be altered. But the fact that that one server is using it means there is a way. After a game update showed that the developers allow users to adjust the holster and draw speed. Judging by its naming convention, I actually guessed the right name and value and in the right location for the reload speed in the theater file. It turns out that the default theater files don't list everything. This also tells me that the feature was always there but never listed in the original theater file, and only recently they released the holster and draw speed variable. I changed the draw speed for only the pistol because I felt it was too slow. Spliffz also agrees. When you run out of your primary, switching to your secondary pistol needs to be fast. I tested several speeds and 1.5x +- 0.1 seems to be the most fitting value. I applied this to pistols only as I felt their only benefit was just more visibility with a smaller weapon.

Spectators have the problem of not always seeing a message from players actually playing. This one is difficult to figure out. There are about 10 different cvars to handle. Sometimes I won't change anything and I'll get different results--some games as spectator, I can see chat and sometimes I cannot. I still haven't quite figured out how to resolve this issue because I keep getting mixed results.

A player reported some bots coming in as errors and only having knives. I noticed this on some maps, too. I tried to load those affected maps again and see if I can see the errors again. Once I was able to repeat the issue on the affected map, I edited the theater file to only show one kind of bot class, and I did this for every class until I saw the whole bot team as errors or only having knives. The problem lied in two classes--one is the VIP with the security weapon, so I gave him an insurgent weapon; the other class was a class in which I added a helmet to. There are still some maps in which the VIP class still use a knife, but its not often and it's pretty funny to see when a player gets knifed. I also like the skin the VIP uses as it is almost camouflage-like.

Because everyone has access to C4 and rocket launchers, I wanted to add a small penalty to it somehow. I decreased the AT4+RPG holster, draw, and aim down sight (in) speed so there's more of a preparation time to use something so powerful in game. The reaction to this change was very poor, and to the players, this is a drastic change. I reverted back to the original speed but made the aim down and holster slightly slower--almost not noticeable. I also decreased the blast radius and penetratioin radius of the rocket launchers. For the C4, I felt that when the counter attack occurred, the players would just detonate it and basically win the counter. To me, the game's gunplay and its heavy recoil system makes this game what it is and separates it from a lot of other shooters. I know if I remove the C4 and rocket launchers, it would be met with a lot of negative feedback. Instead, I chose to quietly decrease its blast and penetration radius. I also removed it from 3 classes that have access to the machine guns. Players didn't seem bothered by it.

I re-enabled weapon sway on weapons because I felt that being suppressed is a really good part of the gameplay. It can encourage a player to stay in cover and ask a teammate for help. By being suppressed, there is more weapon sway and the screen becomes blurred. The bipod is no longer useless either. Weapon stability is greatly increased whereas it was useless I had disabled weapon sway.

I added hunt maps because I hoped it would be a great change from the checkpoints for small groups of players that play on the server during the weekdays, but they never used it so I removed it.

I've seen a lot of times as a spectator when certain bots don't move; they just stay in one place. Almost all of the time it's a specific class. By staying still in one position, the players have a decreased amount of bots to kill and does not accurately reflect the numbner of bots I use on the server. I tested using different number of bots on the server and found that this number is a good balance. Too little and the players won't get the satisfaction from killing the bots. They like it when they get a lot of kills. Having too much causes the server to slow down by a lot and sometimes causes the difficulty to be too hard as most weapons have a 20-30 round magazine. By changing the class to another class, the bot no longer stood still. I believe the game handles each class differently. This class in particular was the marksman class. I supposed they wanted this class to hang back and act as, like its name, a sniper. There are other times when insurgent classes use their throwables more often in my tests. So it wasn't too farfetched to think that the AI handles bot classes differently.

I noticed that players tend to compete with each other for kills. Players are constantly checking their kill count by pressing the tab key to pull up the scoreboard. They will push faster just to get ahead of the team so they can secure the kills for themselves. I wanted to combat against this by disabling the Kill/Death ratio. Luckily, I found the CVAR to handle this from the PVP side of Google searches. I also set the Most Valuable Player screen to display at 0 seconds as a way to disable it as a workaround. Players no longer have to wait for the map vote screen to display after the MVP screen. Unfortunately, I implemented this feature right before I went on a two week vacation, so I was unable to see the initial reaction. After coming back from vacation watching players play in my server, there doesn't seem to be any negative reaction. Too bad, I really wanted to know what people thought about it or noticed it at all. I was told by one admin that he liked this for the same reasons, too.

I wanted to find a SourceMod plugin that would allow some sort of teleportation. This would definitely help move players when they're stuck, instead of fiddling with low gravity, noclip, or kill them and bring them back to life (which they would then have to run back to the next objective). It would also assist in moving players who aren't following the server rules like taking an objective by themselves. What actually transpired gave me one of the best ideas to improve the gameplay since the molotov feature. If I was able to teleport a player to the location of my cursor, then I could teleport a bot to a location... several, or all bots to a location. This means I can manipulate the bot spawn areas of a map. This is big because several of the players play this game so much that they already know the specific location and direction of a counter attack. Because I like to spectate and watch the game's difficulty and fun factor often, I can be the one to change the spawn points or have two bot teams perform a 2 pronged attack on players. It was met with an initial positive/cautious reaction, and then "Oh, you sneaky bastard". They often panic and didn't know where to setup C4 anymore. It was hilarious. Several players pointed out how it was a good thing to keep the players on their toes, to keep the game "fresh". The only concern is that one player didn't like having them spawn in areas they've cleared. It was difficult to do this because the map and checkpoint system has to allow for the flexibility of a good flanking spawn. Not all maps are good for this and not all checkpoints are good for this. I also have to plan ahead and make sure no players are going to see me spawn them in. This is similar to how Left 4 Dead's randomization in each game. The game has a computer-controlled director that randomizes where the common infected wave and special infected spawn from several closets barred from the players. They can spawn behind if there's a straggling player for example, encouraging players to stick together.

One player said he missed having the foregrip on the M249 machine gune. Former developer Jared Ballou said that it was actually his change. By removing the foregrip and only having a bipod, its role was shifted towards a stationary support weapon. When used without the bipod, the intense recoil set itself apart from a new weapon known as the Galil. In contrast, the Galil had a slower fire rate, more manageable recoil and had the foregrip attachment. It was interesting to see a professional talk about the thought process that went into balancing a weapon.

One thing about Spliffz INS Militia servers is that it is located in the Netherlands, which means most of the regulars and I have around a 150ms ping. I looked at many IP addresses of the regular players and saw that they're equally spread across the US with some more towards the east. I tried to setup a server in New York, but although their ping was lower, there was more stutter/lag for a couple of them. Digital Ocean doesn't have any servers located in the middle of the US either, so to keep them happy, I moved the server back to San Francisco.

When I started allowing the AKM--an AK-47 variant--for the players, most would choose it over its security counterpart MP5K. I noticed this through spectating, and I figured it was because it's listed on the top. I preferred players choosing security weapons because of a weapon's audio cues mid-game, but I also wanted the players to have another weapon to play with. I noticed that weapons get thrown to the bottom of the list if you gave it a customized name when I was working on the shotguns, so I just put a line to rename the AKM in the theater file to "AKM". The game saw that as having a custom name even thought it was the same name, but it moved it to the bottom of the list and players would have to scroll down to select it. Basically, players chose it to save themselves time and effort to scroll down the weapons list. Not surprising as there are quite a few items to choose from during the beginning of the round.
